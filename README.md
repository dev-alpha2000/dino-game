Overview
This project is a Dino Game clone built using React. Inspired by the classic Chrome offline dinosaur game, it features a running dinosaur that jumps over obstacles, with increasing difficulty over time. The game is built with simple and engaging mechanics and has a responsive design that works across different devices.

Features
Dino Jumping Mechanism: Users can control the dinosaur to jump over obstacles (cacti).
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the playerâ€™s score, which increases as the dino survives longer.
Obstacle Generation: Randomly generated obstacles that increase in difficulty as the game progresses.
Game Over Screen: Display a game-over screen when the dino hits an obstacle, with an option to restart the game.
Responsive Design: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
